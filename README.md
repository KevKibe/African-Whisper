# Description
This project aims to fine-tune OpenAI's Whisper model to improve Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) capabilities for several local ethnic languages in East and Central Africa. By leveraging the advanced machine learning techniques of the Whisper model, our goal is to create a more inclusive and accessible technology that supports linguistic diversity and aids in the preservation of cultural heritage.

# Objectives
Enhance the accuracy of ASR for native African languages.
Promote technological inclusivity and accessibility.
Support linguistic diversity and cultural heritage preservation.
